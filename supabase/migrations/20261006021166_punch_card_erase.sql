-- PKG-01: punch cards in the privacy erasure (owner (87) ב, 3 November 2026)
-- =============================================================================
-- The cards are in the action log (audit_row, migration punch_cards). A card goes with its contact's purge, so an erasure
-- finds it by its entries, like customer_holds: 'punch_cards' joins the first list of app.audit_erase_core. A card that was
-- transferred or merged away from the person (former_contact_ids) stays with its current holder: app.punch_cards_erase
-- reaches only what was the person's (second review, finding 5; see the function); entries, dates and amounts stay. The helper answers further
-- 'entity:id' children for the caller (none here; PKG-02 adds the used entries of the person's gone cards).
-- * app.audit_erase_core: the body of 021119 (order_pdfs), with 'punch_cards' in the first list and the helper's call.
-- Safe to run twice.

-- When a person held a card: from its creation, or the end of the previous holding, to the end of theirs
-- (holder_history), as closed ranges. Empty when the history does not say (then nothing is known to be theirs).
